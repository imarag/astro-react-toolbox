# Astro-React UI Components

A modular, reusable component library for Astro and React projects.

This repo contains a set of **UI components**, **layout helpers**, and **page sections** built with **daisyUI** and **Tailwind CSS**. Components are designed to be used in both `.astro` and `.jsx` files without duplication.

---

## Key Features

- **Cross-framework components**: Components compatible with both Astro and React JSX.
- **Shared styling logic**: Custom JavaScript functions that return Tailwind/daisyUI class strings, used by both Astro and JSX components to avoid duplication.
- **Semantic, themeable styles**: Leveraging daisyUI’s semantic color classes for consistent theming.
- **Organized folder structure**:  
  - `ui/` — Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, badges)  
  - `layout/` — Layout and structural components (grids, accordions, containers)  
  - `sections/` — Page-level sections (hero, navbar, footer)  
  - `features/` — Domain-specific feature components (e.g., PostList)
